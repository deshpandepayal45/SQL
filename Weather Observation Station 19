Consider and to be two points on a 2D plane where are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and

are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points
and and format your answer to display decimal digits.
ANS:
SELECT ROUND(Sqrt(power(Max(LAT_N)-Min(LAT_N),2)+Power(Max(LONG_W)-Min(LONG_W),2)),4) as EuclideanDistance FROM STATION;
