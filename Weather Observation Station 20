A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to decimal places. 

ANS:

select round(lat_n,4) from (select *,row_number() over(order by lat_n) as rn from station) as a where a.rn = (select ceil(count(*)/2) from station);
